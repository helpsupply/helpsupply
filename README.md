Amidst COVID-19 our hospitals and the people who staff them face unbelievable pressure. We connect healthcare workers to volunteer-powered grocery shopping, childcare and mental health services.

## Contributing

Contributions are extremely welcome. We maintain the following principles for contributors:

### Keep it Simple.
- We need to build a codebase that is highly predictable and quickly modifiable.
- We'd rather have Craigslist in 1 day than Airbnb in 10.
- Only static web pages and APIs.
- We are extremely reluctant to adopt new dependencies.

### This isn't about us.
- We don't want people to use this if it isn't useful.
- We need to be extremely mindful of the cognitive cost of using this and ensure that it is less than the benefit.

### Minimize personal data
- Only need information to validate a user is (or isn't) a healthcare worker.
- Rely on publicly available datasets to cross-check authenticity.
- No passwords needed, just use email and text links to log people in.
