## Lingo & Vocabulary

**Drop Site**: Where supplies can be dropped off.
When a medical facility registers in our system, they are represented as a Drop Site.

**HCP**: Healthcare Provider

## How it works

Users are first directed to an entry portal where they choose to either provide or request medical supplies.

### Requesting Medical Supplies

Medical Staff must sign up with their work email. They can then add their facility and manage their information.

### Provide Medical Supplies

Currently, users must select a facility they want to donate to.

Once a facility is selected, the user can see:

- equipment and quantity requested
- drop-off location
- name of facility
- other donation offers

Users can then donate and provide their contact and donation information.
